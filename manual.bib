abstract = {A concise and self-contained introduction to causal inference, increasingly important in data science and machine learning. The mathematization of causality is a relatively recent development, and has become increasingly important in data science and machine learning. This book offers a self-contained and concise introduction to causal models and how to learn them from data. After explaining the need for causal models and discussing some of the principles underlying causal inference, the book teaches readers how to use causal models: how to compute intervention distributions, how to infer causal models from observational and interventional data, and how causal ideas could be exploited for classical machine learning problems. All of these topics are discussed first in terms of two variables and then in the more general multivariate case. The bivariate case turns out to be a particularly hard problem for causal learning because there are no conditional independences as used by classical methods for solving multivariate cases. The authors consider analyzing statistical asymmetries between cause and effect to be highly instructive, and they report on their decade of intensive research into this problem. The book is accessible to readers with a background in machine learning or statistics, and can be used in graduate courses or as a reference for researchers. The text includes code snippets that can be copied and pasted, exercises, and an appendix with a summary of the most important technical concepts.}

abstract = {Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive
exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from
a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the
fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science,
and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic,
manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple
mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical
associations. The book will open the way for including causal analysis in the standard
curricula of statistics, artificial intelligence, business, epidemiology, social sciences,
and economics. Students in these fields will find natural models, simple inferential
procedures, and precise mathematical definitions of causal concepts that traditional
texts have evaded or made unduly complicated. The first edition of Causality has led
to a paradigmatic change in the way that causality is treated in statistics, philosophy,
computer science, social science, and economics. Cited in more than 3,000 scientific
publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical
thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers'
questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research.
Causality will be of interests to students and professionals in a wide variety of
fields. Anyone who wishes to elucidate meaningful relationships from data, predict
effects of actions and policies, assess explanations of reported events, or form theories
of causal understanding and causal speech will find this book stimulating and invaluable.}
