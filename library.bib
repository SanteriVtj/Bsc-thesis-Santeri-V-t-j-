abstract = {This is an elementary introduction to causal inference in economics written for readers familiar with machine learning methods. The critical step in any causal analysis is estimating the counterfactual-a prediction of what would have happened in the absence of the treatment. The powerful techniques used in machine learning may be useful for developing better estimates of the counterfactual, potentially improving causal inference.},

@article{Pearl2010a,
abstract = {This paper reviews recent advances in the foundations of causal inference and introduces a systematic methodology for defining, estimating, and testing causal claims in experimental and observational studies. It is based on nonparametric structural equation models (SEM)-a natural generalization of those used by econometricians and social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s, which provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring the effects of potential interventions (also called "causal effects" or "policy evaluation"), as well as direct and indirect effects (also known as "mediation"), in both linear and nonlinear systems. Finally, the paper clarifies the role of propensity score matching in causal analysis, defines the relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks, and develops symbiotic tools that use the strong features of both. {\textcopyright} 2010 by American Sociological Association.},

@article{Acemoglu2018,
abstract = {This paper points out that modeling automation as factor-augmenting technological change has several unappealing implications. Instead, modeling it as the process of machines replacing tasks previously performed by labor is both descriptively realistic and leads to distinct and empirically plausible predictions. In contrast to factor-augmenting technological change, the substitution of machines for labor in additional tasks always reduces the labor share in national income and can reduce the equilibrium wage (for realistic parameter values). This approach to automation also enables a discussion of several new forces at work, including the introduction of new tasks, changes in the comparative advantage of labor relative to capital, the deepening of automation (whereby machines be-come more productive in tasks that are already automated), and the role of the elasticity of substitution and capital accumulation in the long-run adjustment of the economy.},

@book{Suarez2009,
abstract = {Future atmospheric conditions are increasingly predictable as a result of scientific and technological advances. From short-term storm forecasts to long-term climate trends, humanitarian organizations now have an unprecedented ability to anticipate threats to people at risk. At the same time, vulnerability patterns are shifting as a result of ongoing processes such as urbanization and the AIDS pandemic, which present complex and dynamic interactions with climate risks. The future looks different: more natural hazards combined with new vulnerabilities will continue to increase the workload of already overstretched humanitarian organizations. Against this background, the complexity and range of possible humanitarian decisions is rapidly expanding, owing to progress in technologies to obtain, process, communicate, and use relevant information, as well as new financial instruments, trends in academic institutions and other promising developments. Humanitarian organizations are adapting to new climate risks, vulnerability patterns, and decision capacity. Yet, regrettably, their efforts seem to be outpaced by the changing threats and opportunities. In order to reduce this gap, it will not be enough to simply train existing staff on new tools, or expand the staff and volunteer base: the humanitarian sector needs to fundamentally restructure its relationship to predictable climate-related threats, evolving towards knowledge-based entities that can rapidly absorb and act upon the increasingly reliable information about changing risks. This will require not just partnering with key stakeholders, but essentially reconfiguring decision-making processes. Many of the potentially catastrophic climate-related disasters could be managed by the humanitarian sector through adequate monitoring of key system variables, and a systematic approach for preparing to act in response to the many plausible early signs of problems. The tasks ahead are massive; it is imperative to think ambitiously.},

abstract = {Researchers have analyzed various forms of extraordinary consumption experiences, using Victor Turner's conceptualization of antistructure with a particular focus on their rather romantic and communal aspects. While such a focus contributed greatly to our understanding of these experiences, it also resulted in overlooking much of their individuated characteristics such as boundaries, conflicts, competition, and positional struggles at the interpersonal level. This ethnographic study of commercialized climbing expeditions on Everest provides significant evidence that participants negotiate and manage various marketplace tensions within an individual performance ideology. Our study challenges quixotic use of Turner's antistructure-structure dichotomy and extends it such that extraordinary experiences, when bought in the marketplace, can be very individualistic and competitive as opposed to being conducive to feelings of community and liminal camaraderie.

@article{Long2020,
abstract = {Many studies have been carried out on stock price trend prediction, but most of them focused on the public market data and did not utilize the trading behaviors owing to the unavailability of real transaction records data. In fact, trading behaviors can better reflect the market movements, and the fusion of trading information and market information can further improve the prediction accuracy. In this paper, we propose a deep neural network model using the desensitized transaction records and public market information to predict stock price trend. Considering the correlation between stocks, our method utilizes the knowledge graph and graph embeddings techniques to select the relevant stocks of the target for constructing the market and trading information. Given the considerable number of investors and the complexity of transaction records data, the investors are clustered to reduce the dimensions of the trading feature matrices, and then the matrices are fed into the convolutional neural network to unearth the investment patterns. Eventually, the attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory network can predict the stock price trends for financial decision support. The experiments on the price movement direction and trend prediction show that our method achieves the best performance in comparison with other prediction baselines.},

Building on the data-driven DAG representation, we uncover the contemporaneous causal patterns between economic activities and environmental pollutants, which is first documented in the literature and could further improve the investigation of the dynamic linkage pattern. The results show that energy consumption uni-directionally Granger causes carbon emissions and economic growth, while there is a bidirectional causality between carbon emissions and economic growth. We also find that trade openness is one of the important determinants of energy consumption and carbon emissions.

The population value is the correlation between the response and its conditional expectation given the predictors, and the sample value is the correlation between the observed response and the model predicted value. We compare four estimators of the measure in terms of bias, mean squared error and behaviour in the presence of overparameterization. The sample estimator and a jack- knife estimator usually behave adequately, but a cross-validation estimator has a large negative bias with large mean squared error. One can use bootstrap methods to construct confidence intervals for the population value of the correlation measure and to estimate the degree to which a model selection procedure may provide an overly optimistic measure of the actual predictive power.

abstract = {The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) is not 'just another regulation' requiring a mere operational and compliance approach, hut an accelerator of the already on-going change in the fabric of the -- digitisation prone -- financial industry. The PSD 2 provisions on 'Access to account' for Payment Initiation and Account Information Services ('XS2A') will accelerate this by forcing banks to open up consumer payment accounts for appropriately licensed, innovative (bank and non-bank fintech) service providers. A pivotal element to this concept of opening up payment accounts is the development of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) by banks. Fintech players are seeking to capitalise on the emerging API landscape and to capture customer and developer mindshare as well as payment and non-payment (data rich service) revenues long taken for granted by incumbent financial institutions. The key challenge for leaders of incumbent financial institutions is to ensure PSD2 XS2A compliance, while at the same time retaining customer relevance and maximising addressable market and revenue potential across a rich transaction services portfolio. A PIs could redefine the financial services distribution game of banks. Some financial institutions see PSD2 XS2A and APIs as an opportunity to work closer with emerging fintech companies. Others see it as a threat to their business. This has led to different strategic choices for banking leaders. The authors have identified four generic strategic options (ie, Comply, Compete, Expand, and Transform), fitting the wider spectrum of leader attitudes towards PSD2 XS2A and adoption of APIs as a business strategy. All options come unth strategic, tactical, and operational considerations and will be elaborated upon in this paper. Making the 'right' strategic decision will require banking executives to (re-)consider their future ambition, desired position in the value chain, the accompanying transaction portfolio, and impact on the operating model.

@article{Mueller2021,
abstract = {The problem of individualization is recognized as crucial in almost every field. Identifying causes of effects in specific events is likewise essential for accurate decision making. However, such estimates invoke counterfactual relationships, and are therefore indeterminable from population data. For example, the probability of benefiting from a treatment concerns an individual having a favorable outcome if treated and an unfavorable outcome if untreated. Experiments conditioning on fine-grained features are fundamentally inadequate because we can't test both possibilities for an individual. Tian and Pearl provided bounds on this and other probabilities of causation using a combination of experimental and observational data. Even though those bounds were proven tight, narrower bounds, sometimes significantly so, can be achieved when structural information is available in the form of a causal model. This has the power to solve central problems, such as explainable AI, legal responsibility, and personalized medicine, all of which demand counterfactual logic. We analyze and expand on existing research by applying bounds to the probability of necessity and sufficiency (PNS) along with graphical criteria and practical applications.},

They are less commonly applied to financial time series predictions, yet inherently suitable for this domain. We deploy LSTM networks for predicting out-of-sample directional movements for the constituent stocks of the S{\&}P 500 from 1992 until 2015. With daily returns of 0.46 percent and a Sharpe ratio of 5.8 prior to transaction costs, we find LSTM networks to outperform memory-free classification methods, i.e., a random forest (RAF), a deep neural net (DNN), and a logistic regression classifier (LOG). The outperformance relative to the general market is very clear from 1992 to 2009, but as of 2010, excess returns seem to have been arbitraged away with LSTM profitability fluctuating around zero after transaction costs. We further unveil sources of profitability, thereby shedding light into the black box of artificial neural networks. Specifically, we find one common pattern among the stocks selected for trading – they exhibit high volatility and a short-term reversal return profile. Leveraging these findings, we are able to formalize a rules-based short-term reversal strategy that yields 0.23 percent prior to transaction costs. Further regression analysis unveils low exposure of the LSTM returns to common sources of systematic risk – also compared to the three benchmark models.},

@book{Freeman2010,
abstract = {This chapter reviews what economists have learned about the impact of labor market institutions, defined broadly as government regulations and union activity on labor outcomes in developing countries. It finds that: (1) Labor institutions vary greatly among developing countries but less than they vary among advanced countries. Unions and collective bargaining are less important in developing than in advanced countries while government regulations are nominally as important. (2) Many developing countries' compliance with minimum wage regulations produces spikes in wage distributions around the minimum in covered sectors. Most studies find modest adverse effects of the minimum on employment so that the minimum raises the total income of lowpaid labor. (3) In many countries minimum wages "spillover" to the unregulated sector, producing spikes in the wage distributions there as well. (4) Employment protection regulations and related laws shift output and employment to informal sectors and reduce gross labor mobility. (5) Mandated benefits increase labor costs and reduce employment modestly while the costs of others is shifted largely to labor, with some variation among countries. (6) Contrary to the Harris-Todaro two-sector model in which rural-urban migration adjusts to produce a positive relation between unemployment and wages across regions and sectors, wages and unemployment are inversely related by the "wage curve." (7) Unions affect nonwage outcomes as well as wage outcomes. (8) Cross-country regressions yield inconclusive results on the impact of labor regulations on growth while studies of country adjustments to economic shocks, such as balance of payments problems, find no difference in the responses of countries by the strength of labor institutions. (9) Labor institution can be critical when countries experience great change, as in China's growth spurt and Argentina's preservation of social stability and democracy after its 2001-2002 economic collapse. Cooperative labor relations tend to produce better economic outcomes. (10) The informal sector increased its share of the work force in the developing world in the past two decades. The persistence of large informal sectors throughout the developing world, including countries with high rates of growth, puts a premium on increasing our knowledge of how informal sector labor markets work and finding institutions and policies to deliver social benefits to workers in that sector. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This study investigates consumers' relationship to possessions in the condition of contemporary global nomadism. Prior research argues that consumers form enduring and strong attachments to possessions because of their centrality to identity projects. This role is heightened in life transitions including cross-border movements as possessions anchor consumer's identities either to their homeland or to the host country. This study reexamines this claim via in-depth interviews with elite global nomads, deterritorialized consumers who engage in serial relocation and frequent short-term international mobility. An alternative relationship to possessions characterized by detachment and flexibility emerges, which is termed "liquid." Three characteristics of a liquid relationship to possessions are identified: temporary situational value, use-value, and immateriality. The study outlines a logic of nomadic consumption, that of instrumentality, where possessions and practices are strategic resources in managing mobility. A liquid perspective on possessions expands current understandings of materiality, acculturation, and globalization. {\textcopyright} 2012 by JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH, Inc.},

abstract = {Abstract The debate about the usefulness of the civil society concept for social analysis has reached a critical stage and calls for its abandonment are mounting. To prove its relevance for policy, practice and research, better operational concepts and more rigorous empirical research on civil society are required. This article examines the possibilities and pitfalls of cross-national civil society research as a crucial area of empirical civil society studies. It explores the definition, conceptualization, operationalization and measurement of civil society through a critical examination of existing international efforts at comparative civil society analysis. A functional approach to defining civil society and a two-dimensional operational concept of civil society, according to its (1) structural and (2) cultural features, are proposed as suitable tools to study the phenomenon cross-nationally. The article also reviews the Civicus Civil Society Index as an innovative tool to assess the state of civil society and discusses the insights and challenges emerging from its current application in more than 50 countries. The paper concludes that international comparative civil society studies are both possible and necessary, but cautions that more attention needs to be paid to the development of appropriate operational concepts and measurement models.},

Our goal is to empirically assess the relative importance of these two possibilities, distinguishing between national and international R{\&}D outsourcing and firms' exporting status. We examine R{\&}D purchases of more than 10,000 Spanish firms for the period 2004–2014. We show that R{\&}D outsourcing improves firm innovation. Product innovation rises mostly with domestic outsourcing, while process innovation increases with both domestic and international R{\&}D outsourcing. In addition, we find that international outsourcing provides an extra premium, mostly for exporters.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore tactical planning in grocery retailing and propose how process and integration mechanisms from sales and operations planning (S{\&}OP) can enhance retail tactical planning. Design/methodology/approach: This work follows an explorative design with case studies from the grocery retailing industry in Finland, Norway, and the UK. Findings: The tactical planning process focuses on demand management and securing product availability from suppliers in order to reach sales targets. Less attention is directed toward balancing supply and demand or toward providing a single plan to guide company operations. Planning appeared to be functionally oriented with limited coordination between functional plans, but it did include external integration that improved forecast accuracy. Research limitations/implications: The study involves grocery retailer cases with variable levels of S{\&}OP maturity. The propositions need to be investigated further through action research or additional case studies to confirm their validity. Practical implications: The study proposes a design of an S{\&}OP process in retailing and propositions for improving tactical planning integration. Originality/value: The study complements research on retail tactical planning by taking planning process and integration viewpoints. The research suggests that retailers would benefit from a formal and company-wide S{\&}OP process to unify different market-oriented plans to a single set of numbers, thus better balancing supply and demand without sacrificing the emphasis on demand planning.},

abstract = {In framing studies, logically equivalent choice situations are differently described and the resulting preferences are studied. A meta-analysis of framing effects is presented for risky choice problems which are framed either as gains or as losses. This evaluates the finding that highlighting the positive aspects of formally identical problems does lead to risk aversion and that highlighting their equivalent negative aspects does lead to risk seeking. Based on a data pool of 136 empirical papers that reported framing experiments with nearly 30,000 participants, we calculated 230 effect sizes. Results show that the overall framing effect between conditions is of small to moderate size and that profound differences exist between research designs. Potentially relevant characteristics were coded for each study. The most important characteristics were whether framing is manipulated by changing reference points or by manipulating outcome salience, and response mode (choice vs. rating/judgment). Further important characteristics were whether options differ qualitatively or quantitatively in risk, whether there is one or multiple risky events, whether framing is manipulated by gain/loss or by task-responsive wording, whether dependent variables are measured between- or within- subjects, and problem domains. Sample (students vs. target populations) and unit of analysis (individual vs. group) was not influential. It is concluded that framing is a reliable phenomenon, but that outcome salience manipulations, which constitute a considerable amount of work, have to be distinguished from reference point manipulations and that procedural features of experimental settings have a considerable effect on effect sizes in framing experiments. {\textcopyright} 1998 Academic Press.},

In the absence of randomized experiments, identification of reliable intervention points to improve oral health is often perceived as a challenge. But other fields of science, such as social science, have always been challenged by ethical constraints to conducting randomized controlled trials. Methods have been established to make causal inference using observational data, and these methods are becoming increasingly relevant in clinical medicine, health policy and public health research. This study provides an overview of state-of-the-art methods specifically designed for causal inference in observational data, including difference-in-differences (DiD) analyses, instrumental variables (IV), regression discontinuity designs (RDD) and fixed-effects panel data analysis. The described methods may be particularly useful in dental research, not least because of the increasing availability of routinely collected administrative data and electronic health records (‘big data').},

The search was based on the PubMed database. All cohort studies published in peer-reviewed journals were selected. Studies on periodontal disease and mortality were excluded if they did not provide information on the number of teeth. Risk estimates from studies with appropriate exposure definition, confounder adjustment and sample size were included in a meta-analysis. Three high-quality studies found a relationship between the number of teeth and circulatory mortality, whereas a moderate study did not. Two out of four moderate- to high-quality studies reported a relationship between the number of teeth and all-cause mortality. No study has investigated whether replaced teeth are protective against mortality. Therefore, denture use was taken as proxy. The methodological quality of studies on denture use and mortality was generally low to moderate. The findings of two moderate studies indicated an effect of prosthodontic replacements on all-cause mortality, which was supported in bias analysis. It is open whether competing risks of cause-specific death other than circulatory mortality reduce an effect of the number of teeth on all-cause mortality. An effect of denture use on circulatory mortality remains to be established, as well as whether the number of replaced teeth affects mortality. Specifying the role of potential pathways by which tooth loss-related mortality is mediated will possibly increase the value of dental treatment for general health.},

From the thriving brick and mortar stores and the development of shopping centres, malls and retail chains throughout the 1900's, retail has become increasingly digital as multi-sided marketplaces are uniting the online and offline to create more sophisticated and personalized customer experiences.

abstract = {This paper brings together two related bodies of theory that assist understanding of processes of socio-technical system change on the global scale. These are, first, the Global Value Chain perspective (GVC) that has now mutated into Global Production Networks (GPN) and, more recently, Global Innovation Networks (GIN). Examples of why this should be are exemplified (e.g. Scandinavia's mobile telephony 'creative destruction'). The second perspective is that of Territorial Innovation Systems. This addresses the innovative core of 'creative destruction' events which, in turn, explains economic growth and development. In recent times this has been significantly undergirded by means of concepts like 'relatedness', 'proximity' and 'path dependence'. These perspectives are combined to produce a framework for analysing the contribution of an increasingly commoditised ICT assembly industry to high-value, customised 'chipset' and 'apps' design around smartphones, netbooks and flat panel display (FPD) technologies that express the GIN/TIS complex in global 'value curve' integration. Here 'creative destruction' recombinations arise because, from an evolutionary perspective, the regions in which they emerge display technological 'relatedness' and regional 'regimes' that foster co-innovation, in this case ICT-based co-innovation.},

@article{Chen2009a,
abstract = {In mature markets with competing firms, a common role for advertising is to shift consumer preferences towards the advertiser in a tug-of-war, with no effect on category demand. In this paper, we analyze the effect of such "combative" advertising on market power. We show that, depending on the nature of consumer response, combative advertising can reduce price competition to benefit competing firms. However, it can also lead to a procompetitive outcome where individual firms advertise to increase their own profitability, but collectively become worse off. This is because combative advertising can intensify price competition such that an "advertising war" leads to a "price war." Similar to price competition, advertising competition can result in a prisoner's dilemma where all competing firms make less profit even when the effect of each firm's advertising is to enhance consumer preferences in its favor. Given such procompetitive effects, we further show that cost of combative advertising could be a blessing in disguise - higher unit cost of advertising resulting in lower equilibrium levels of advertising, leading to higher prices and profits. We conduct a laboratory experiment to investigate how combative advertising by competing brands influences consumer preferences. Our experimental analysis offers strong support for our conclusions. {\textcopyright} 2009 INFORMS.},

Shifts in civil rights actions from the first angry white Southern resistance--through organized Negro demonstrations-to Negro violence may be charted in the language employed by the polls from year to year. Questions fall into the following categories: general opinion of demonstrations for civil rights, public opinion on the effectiveness of Negro actions of various kinds, what people think are the causes of the racial unrest; the extent to which people have expected racial violence fear of violence how widespread the support for riots is thought to be in the Negro community who has suffered most from the riots, and suggestions for the control and solution to the problem of racial outbreaks.},

The main results indicate that there is a stable contemporaneous causal flow from crude oil to natural gas. Unlike most of the previous research, we found a long-term equilibrium relationship between crude oil and natural gas returns when additional factors were taken into account. However, the impact of oil price returns on natural gas price volatility has decreased after the 2008 global financial crisis. Finally, storage and seasonality factors can never be ignored when analysing natural gas prices, while the impact of speculative activity on natural gas volatility is relatively weak.},

Highly similar patterns were observed in each of 3 occupational groups: human services, industry, and transport (total N = 374). In addition, results confirmed the 2-factor structure (exhaustion and disengagement) of a new burnout instrument - the Oldenburg Burnout Inventory - and suggested that this structure is essentially invariant across occupational groups.},

abstract = {Despite a long-term decline in the circus industry, Cirque du Soleil profitably increased revenue 22-fold over the last ten years by reinventing the circus. Rather than competing within the confines of the existing industry or trying to steal customers from rivals, Cirque developed uncontested market space that made the competition irrelevant. Cirque created what the authors call a blue ocean, a previously unknown market space. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In red oceans-that is, in all the industries already existing-companies compete by grabbing for a greater share of limited demand. As the market space gets more crowded, prospects for profits and growth decline. Products turn into commodities, and increasing competition turns the water bloody. There are two ways to create blue oceans. One is to launch completely new industries, as eBay did with online auctions. But it's much more common for a blue ocean to be created from within a red ocean when a company expands the boundaries of an existing industry. In studying more than 150 blue ocean creations in over 30 industries, the authors observed that the traditional units of strategic analysis-company and industry-are of limited use in explaining how and why blue oceans are created. The most appropriate unit of analysis is the strategic move, the set of managerial actions and decisions involved in making a major market-creating business offering. Creating blue oceans builds brands. So powerful is blue ocean strategy, in fact, that a blue ocean strategic move can create brand equity that lasts for decades.},

In this paper, we disentangle the effect of observing a peer from that of being observed by a peer, by setting up a real effort experiment in which we manipulate the observability of performance. In particular, we randomize subjects into three groups: in the first one subjects are observed by another subject, but do not observe anybody; in the second one subjects observe somebody else's performance, but are not observed by anybody; in the last group subjects work in isolation, neither observing, nor being observed. To assess the importance of payoff externalities in the emergence of peer effects, we consider both a piece rate compensation scheme, where pay depends solely on own performance, and a team compensation scheme, where pay also depends on the performance of other team members. Overall, we find some evidence that subjects who are observed increase productivity at least initially when compensation is team based, while we find that subjects observing react to what they see when compensation is based only on own performance.},

One method to create probabilities is to directly train a kernel classifier with a logit link function and a regularized maximum likelihood score. However, training with a maximum likelihood score will produce non-sparse kernel machines. Instead, we train an SVM, then train the parameters of an additional sigmoid function to map the SVM outputs into probabilities. This chapter compares classification error rate and likelihood scores for an SVM plus sigmoid versus a kernel method trained with a regularized likelihood error function. These methods are tested on three data-mining-style data sets. The SVM+sigmoid yields probabilities of comparable quality to the regularized maximum likelihood kernel method, while still retaining the sparseness of the SVM.},

Finally, we highlight newly developed methods at the intersection of ML and econometrics, methods that typically perform better than either off-the-shelf ML or more traditional econometric methods when applied to particular classes of problems, problems that include causal inference for average treatment effects, optimal policy estimation, and estimation of the counterfactual effect of price changes in consumer choice models.},

Considering the numerous ways social media affects individuals and businesses alike, in this article, the authors focus on where they believe the future of social media lies when considering marketing-related topics and issues. Drawing on academic research, discussions with industry leaders, and popular discourse, the authors identify nine themes, organized by predicted imminence (i.e., the immediate, near, and far futures), that they believe will meaningfully shape the future of social media through three lenses: consumer, industry, and public policy. Within each theme, the authors describe the digital landscape, present and discuss their predictions, and identify relevant future research directions for academics and practitioners.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a theoretical framework that describes the importance of affect in guiding judgments and decisions. As used here, "affect" means the specific quality of "goodness" or "badness" (i) experienced as a feeling state (with or without consciousness) and (ii) demarcating a positive or negative quality of a stimulus. Affective responses occur rapidly and automatically-note how quickly you sense the feelings associated with the stimulus word "treasure" or the word "hate". We argue that reliance on such feelings can be characterized as "the affect heuristic". In this paper we trace the development of the affect heuristic across a variety of research paths followed by ourselves and many others. We also discuss some of the important practical implications resulting from ways that this heuristic impacts our daily lives. {\textcopyright} 2002 Cambridge University Press.},

Rather than assuming a tight fit between formal rules and political behavior, these studies examine how variation in the stability and/or enforcement of formal rules shapes actors' expectations and behavior. This article explores the emerging research agenda on institutional strength. It disaggregates the concept of institutional strength into two dimensions-enforcement and stability-and it argues that institutions vary widely on both dimensions. The article then examines the sources of this variation and its implications for comparative research. It shows how recent research on weak institutions may be used to refine existing theories of institutional effects, design, and development, which should broaden the comparative scope of these theories.

@article{Dijkstra1982,
abstract = {Since the summer of 1973, when I became a Burroughs Research Fellow, my life has been very different from what it had been before. The daily routine changed: instead of going to the University each day, where I used to spend most of my time in the company of others, I now went there only one day a week and was most of the time that is, when not travelling!-- alone in my study. In my solitude, mail and the written word in general became more and more important. The circumstance that my employer and I had the Atlantic Ocean between us was a further incentive to keep a fairly complete record of what I was doing. The public part of that output found its place in what became known as "the EWD series", which can be viewed as a form of scientific correspondence, possible since the advent of the copier. (That same copier makes it hard to estimate its actual distribution: I myself made about two dozen copies of my texts, but their recipients were welcome to act as further nodes of the distribution tree.) The decision to publish a selection from the EWD series in book form was at first highly embarrassing, but as the months went by I got used to the idea. As soon as some guiding principles had been adopted -- preferably not published elsewhere, as varied and as representative as possible, etc.-- the actual selection process was much easier than I had feared. Harder to decide was the question to how much editing the selected texts should be subjected. When the texts are viewed as historical documents, their editing should be minimal. When David Gries went through the texts with his fine-toothed comb he revealed so many opportunities for improvement that, eventually, the editing became quite extensive. As a result, the texts as published are not representative of my mastery of the English language. A major obstacle to publication was my insistence that selected trip reports be included. Having decided that the selection should be representative, I had no choice, since the period in question covers years during which I was on the road a third of the time. Furthermore, few of my texts reflect my feelings and attitudes more clearly than the trip reports. (It has been remarked that my trip reports are more revealing about their author than about the people and places visited.) There was only one snag: there is no tradition of publishing such comments. While performing artists are quite used to being judged publicly by their peers, performing scientists are not. (Reviews of published books and articles are the closest approximation.)},

abstract = {Objective. There is increasing evidence suggesting that low total testosterone concentration is associated with incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in men. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between total testosterone and incident T2DM in a large population-based cohort. Methods. Of 2117 men at baseline, 1589 were followed up 5 years later. Low total testosterone concentration at baseline determined by {\textless}10th percentile (10-year age-strata) were used as a risk factor for incident T2DM at follow-up. To evaluate for potential non-response bias, drop out weights were used in sensitivity analysis. Results. From 1339 men eligible for analyses, 68 (5.1{\%}) developed T2DM. Men with low total testosterone concentration had an increased risk of developing T2DM (odds ratio [OR] 3.4, 95{\%} CI 1.9-6.1), even after adjustment for age, waist circumference and smoking, OR 3.0; (95{\%} CI 1.6-5.7). Recalculated weighted models revealed almost identical estimates indicating no relevant non-response bias. Discussion. Our prospective findings suggest that low total testosterone concentration is associated with incident T2DM in men and might represent a biomarker that might causally be involved in the risk of T2DM. This underlines the importance of measuring total testosterone in men as the predominant male sex hormone. {\textcopyright} 2011 Informa UK, Ltd.},

I describe how experimental and non-experimental methods have been used, across the social sciences, to investigate how happiness drives, and is driven by, particular behavioural tendencies. I consider interpersonal behaviour (selfishness, trust and reciprocity) and individual behaviour (risk and time preferences). Regarding interpersonal behaviour, a general conclusion is that happiness results from pro-social behaviour. Happiness negatively correlates with selfishness and positively correlates with trust; in both cases there is stronger evidence that the behaviour is a cause of happiness than a consequence of it. Individuals also gain happiness from inflicting costly punishment on those who have harmed them, although being happy reduces the degree to which people are willing to dole out such punishment in the first place. Regarding individual behaviour, the relationship between happiness and risk preferences remains unclear despite a large body of research on the topic, while there is evidence that happiness affects time preferences by reducing impatience. In all cases, I draw distinctions between the long- and short- term relationships between happiness and behaviour.},

Such VAAs play a major role in many countries. In this paper, we describe the development and large-scale application of a new innovative matching algorithm for the most widely used VAA in Finland. We worked closely with the owner of the VAA, the largest daily newspaper in Finland, Helsingin Sanomat. Their previous algorithm, which one might call a “naive” approach, was improved by including measures of candidate's political power and influence, using proxy variables of media visibility and incumbency status. The VAA was implemented for the 2015 Parliamentary Election in Finland; our matching algorithm was used by 140,000 voters (26.7{\%} of the electorate) in the Helsinki election district. The innovative algorithm generated recommendations that many voters were happy about, followed by users' incidental comments that this was the first time the VAA recommended candidates they wanted to vote for. This showed the importance of catering to different kinds of voters with a model not previously considered by any VAA in any country.},

The main idea is to effectively measure the complexity of the hypothesis space, as defined by the set of possible classifiers, and to use this quantity as a penalty term for guiding the model selection process. Unfortunately, the conventional SVM formulation defines a hypothesis space centered at the origin, which can cause undesired effects on the selection of the optimal classifier. We propose here a more flexible SVM formulation, which addresses this drawback, and describe a practical method for selecting more effective hypothesis spaces, leading to the improvement of the generalization ability of the final classifier. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

Using a unique and a manually collected dataset, we identify 698 CBAs made by emerging country firms during the period January 1991 through December 2008. Targets tend to be small (by U.S. transaction value measures) - the median ranging between {\$}10 million and {\$}40 million (in 2008 dollars). However, from 2000 to 2008, 24 acquisitions were worth more than a billion dollars each. Emerging country acquirers experience a positive and a significant market response of 1.09{\%} on the announcement day. Additionally, in the cross-section, acquirer returns are positively correlated with (better) corporate governance measures in the target country. The positive announcement return and the cross-sectional relation between these returns and governance measures are consistent with Martynova and Renneboog's (2008) and Khanna and Palepu's (2004) bootstrapping hypothesis: the acquirer voluntarily bootstraps itself to the higher governance standards of the target - resulting in a positive valuation impact for the acquirer. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The essay is an attempt to examine aspects of legal interpretation from an external, sociological point of view. “Interpretation”, in its normal juristic sense, is primarily a process in which decision‐makers with secondary legitimacy link their decisions to authority of primary legitimacy. The type of legitimacy which is dominant within the legal system greatly influences the style of interpretation ‐ in “closed” systems, where the stock of premises is fixed, “legalism” will abound. Legal interpretation is not concerned with what a text really means, in any literal sense; and standards for judging legal interpretation are different from the standards of judging other forms of communication, for example, literature. Indeed, a judge can be considered great precisely because of his creative acts of misinterpretation. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1988, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {We examine the concerns that new technologies will render labor redundant in a framework in which tasks previously performed by labor can be automated and new versions of existing tasks, in which labor has a comparative advantage, can be created. In a static version where capital is fixed and technology is exogenous, automation reduces employment and the labor share, and may even reduce wages, while the creation of new tasks has the opposite effects. Our full model endogenizes capital accumulation and the direction of research toward automation and the creation of new tasks. If the long-run rental rate of capital relative to the wage is sufficiently low, the long-run equilibrium involves automation of all tasks. Otherwise, there exists a stable balanced growth path in which the two types of innovations go hand-in-hand. Stability is a consequence of the fact that automation reduces the cost of producing using labor, and thus discourages further automation and encourages the creation of new tasks. In an extension with heterogeneous skills, we show that inequality increases during transitions driven both by faster automation and the introduction of new tasks, and characterize the conditions under which inequality stabilizes in the long run.},

He showed that causal parameters are defined using hypothetical models that assign variation to some of the inputs determining outcomes while holding all other inputs ˝fixed. He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) used in one influential recent approach to causality (Pearl, 2000) and in the related literature on Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare an approach based on Haavelmo's methodology with a standard approach in the causal literature of DAGs– the "do-calculus" of Pearl (2009). We discuss the limitations of DAGs and in particular of the do-calculus of Pearl in securing identification of economic models. We extend our framework to consider models for simultaneous causality, a central contribution of Haavelmo (1944). In general cases, DAGs cannot be used to analyze models for simultaneous causality, but Haavelmo's approach naturally generalizes to cover it.},

In fact, beyond of sales forecasting in general a crucial question remains whether a product may sell well or not. Assuming three classes as substantial, middle and inconsiderable, the forecasting problem comes down to a classification problem, where the task is to predict the class of a product. In this research, we present a probabilistic approach to identify the class of fashion products in terms of sale. Thereafter, we combine kernel machines with a probabilistic approach to empower the performance of kernel machines and eventually to make use of it to predicting the number of sales. The proposed approach is more robust to outliers (in the case of highly sold products) and in addition uses prior knowledge, hence it serves more reliable results. In order to verify the proposed approach, we conducted several experiments on a real data extracted from an apparel retailer in Germany.},

Although prior research has shown that zero carries a special meaning, no prior research has specifically examined the framing of zero. Across four studies, the current research demonstrates the effect the framing of zero has on judgment and decision-making and explores the underlying mechanisms. In the context of a simple gamble a small loss is more attractive than gaining nothing, but the same small loss is less attractive than losing nothing. The present studies test and support an explanation of these findings based on the concept of reference points and the affect heuristic. The framing of zero in these decision problems acts as a point of comparison, or reference point, affecting how evaluators feel about the bet. These results establish the importance of framing zero in judgment and decision-making and sheds light on the mediators of this effect.},

abstract = {A large literature on causal inference in statistics, econometrics, biostatistics, and epidemiology (see, e.g., Imbens and Rubin [2015] for a recent survey) has focused on methods for statistical estimation and inference in a setting where the researcher wishes to answer a question about the (counterfactual) impact of a change in a policy, or “treatment” in the terminology of the literature. The policy change has not necessarily been observed before, or may have been observed only for a subset of the population; examples include a change in minimum wage law or a change in a firm's price. The goal is then to estimate the impact of small set of “treatments” using data from randomized experiments or, more commonly, “observational” studies (that is, non- experimental data). The literature identifies a variety of assumptions that, when satisfied, allow the researcher to draw the same types of conclusions that would be available from a randomized experiment. To estimate causal effects given non- random assignment of individuals to alternative policies in observational studies, popular techniques include propensity score weighting, matching, and regression analysis; all of these methods adjust for differences in observed attributes of individuals. Another strand of literature in econometrics, referred to as “structural modeling,” fully specifies the preferences of actors as well as a behavioral model, and estimates those parameters from data (for applications to auction-based electronic commerce, see Athey and Haile [2007] and Athey and Nekipelov [2012]). In both cases, parameter estimates are interpreted as “causal,” and they are used to make predictions about the effect of policy changes. In},

Building upon but going beyond previous conceptualizations, the model outlines the ways in which intrinsic motivation (which arises from the intrinsic value of the work for the individual) might interact with extrinsic motivation (which arises from the desire to obtain outcomes that are apart from the work itself). In a modification of the prevailing psychological view that extrinsic motivation undermines intrinsic motivation, this conceptualization proposes that certain types of extrinsic motivation can combine synergistically with intrinsic motivation, particularly when initial levels of intrinsic motivation are high. Such synergistic motivational combinations should lead to high levels of employee satisfaction and performance. Two mechanisms are proposed for these combinations: extrinsics in service of intrinsics, and the motivation-work cycle match. Personality and work-environment influences on motivation are discussed, and implications are outlined for management practice and management development. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

Focusing on the determinants of migration and its influence on local communities, this dissertation consists of three chapters. Chapter 1 provides a brief introduction to the thesis, covering the motivation for the research, the methodologies used, and policy implications. Chapter 2 estimates the impact of education on two key outcomes: migration probability and distance. Migration greatly affects the regional economy, and hence, the out-migration of highly educated workers has raised serious concerns for regional development. The OLS estimator indicates a small but positive effect of education on both outcomes, which is similar to other studies. However, using compulsory schooling law changes as an instrumental variable, the 2SLS estimator suggests that education increases migration distance but decreases the probability to migrate. To guide the analysis, this paper expands the basic migration model to include . . .},

He thus formalized and made operational Marshall's (1890) ceteris paribus analysis. We embed Haavelmo's framework into the recursive framework of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) commonly used in the literature of causality (Pearl, 2000) and Bayesian nets (Lauritzen, 1996). We compare the analysis of causality based on a methodology inspired by Haavelmo's ideas with other approaches used in the causal literature of DAGs. We discuss the limitations of methods that solely use the information expressed in DAGs for the identification of economic models.

Although prior research has shown that zero carries a special meaning, no prior research has specifically examined the framing of zero. Across four studies, the current research demonstrates the effect the framing of zero has on judgment and decision-making and explores the underlying mechanisms. In the context of a simple gamble a small loss is more attractive than gaining nothing, but the same small loss is less attractive than losing nothing. The present studies test and support an explanation of these findings based on the concept of reference points and the affect heuristic. The framing of zero in these decision problems acts as a point of comparison, or reference point, affecting how evaluators feel about the bet. These results establish the importance of framing zero in judgment and decision-making and sheds light on the mediators of this effect.},

abstract = {People increasingly seek out opportunities to escape from a sped-up pace of life by engaging in slow forms of consumption. Drawing from the theory of social acceleration, we explore how consumers can experience and achieve a sloweddown experience of time through consumption. To do so, we ethnographically study the Camino de Santiago pilgrimage in Spain and introduce the concept of consumer deceleration. Consumer deceleration is a perception of a slowed-down temporal experience achieved via a decrease in certain quantities (traveled distance, use of technology, experienced episodes) per unit of time through altering, adopting, or eschewing forms of consumption. Consumers decelerate in three ways: embodied, technological, and episodic. Each is enabled by consumer practices and market characteristics, rules, and norms, and results in time being experienced as passing more slowly and as being an abundant resource. Achieving deceleration is challenging, as it requires resynchronization to a different temporal logic and the ability to manage intrusions from acceleration. Conceptualizing consumer deceleration allows us to enhance our understanding of temporality and consumption, embodied consumption, extraordinary experiences, and the theory of social acceleration. Overall, this study contributes to consumer research by illuminating the role of speed and rhythm in consumer culture.},

Recognizing that consumption activities, product categories, or even brands may serve as the basis for interaction and social cohesion, the concept of the subculture of consumption solves many problems inherent in the use of ascribed social categories as devices for understanding consumer behavior. This article is based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork with Harley-Davidson motorcycle owners. A key feature of the fieldwork was a process of progressive contextualization of the researchers from outsiders to insiders situated within the subculture. Analysis of the social structure, dominant values, and revealing symbolic behaviors of this distinct, consumption-oriented subculture have led to the advancement of a theoretical framework that situates subcultures of consumption in the context of modern consumer culture and discusses, among other implications, a symbiosis between such subcultures and marketing institutions. Transferability of the principal findings of this research to other subcultures of consumption is established through comparisons with ethnographies of other self-selecting, consumption-oriented subcultures.},

abstract = {Telecommuting has long been noted for its ability to foster work-family balance and job satisfaction. However, for employees seeking to advance in their careers, it is commonly advised to exercise caution, since telecommuting is often viewed as signaling a lack of dedication to one's career. Despite the prevalence of such advice, almost no research has investigated if telecommuting actually impacts career success in objective terms. Integrating research on the flexibility stigma and signaling theory, we first compared the career success of telecommuters and non-telecommuters using a sample of 405 employees matched with corporate data on promotion and salary growth. Then, we examined the relationship between extent of telecommuting and career success as well as the moderating influence of contextual factors. Results indicated telecommuters and non-telecommuters did not differ in number of promotions, but telecommuters experienced lower salary growth. Additionally, extent of telecommuting was negatively related to promotions and salary growth, indicating it is not simply telecommuting per se that effects career success, but rather the extent of telecommuting. Moreover, work context played a highly influential role. A greater number of promotions were received by extensive telecommuters when they worked where telecommuting was highly normative, and when they engaged in higher supplemental work. Extensive telecommuters with higher supplemental work and higher face-to-face contact with their supervisor also received greater salary growth. Together, results challenge previous research that has tended to portray telecommuting as harmful to one's career success by providing a more informed understanding of how to harness its benefits.},

Though this all-in-one method works well, there is another choice - the one-in-one method where each binary SVM model is selected independently and separately.

abstract = {The p-curve, the distribution of statistically significant p-values of published studies, has been used to make inferences on the proportion of true effects and on the presence of phacking in the published literature. We analyze the p-curve for observational research in the presence of p-hacking. We show by means of simulations that even with minimal omittedvariable bias (e.g., unaccounted confounding) p-curves based on true effects and p-curves based on null-effects with p-hacking cannot be reliably distinguished. We also demonstrate this problem using as practical example the evaluation of the effect of malaria prevalence on economic growth between 1960 and 1996. These findings call recent studies into question that use the p-curve to infer that most published research findings are based on true effects in the medical literature and in a wide range of disciplines. p-values in observational research may need to be empirically calibrated to be interpretable with respect to the commonly used significance threshold of 0.05. Violations of randomization in experimental studies may also result in situations where the use of p-curves is similarly unreliable.},

It argues that a standard method of empirical economics, multiple regression, is inadequate for most but the simplest applications, that the Bayes' nets approach, which can be understood as a generalisation of Suppes' theory, constitutes a considerable improvement but is still subject to important limitations, and that the currently fashionable ‘design-based approach' suffers from the same flaws Suppes anticipated a long time ago. It then sketches an alternative in response, one that differs drastically from the formalisms Suppes endorsed but is consistent with his pragmatic general take on science.},

abstract = {Purpose: Despite the importance of collaborative planning, forecasting, and replenishment (CPFR), its influence on supply chain innovation capability (SCIC) and supply chain performance (SCP) has not been sufficiently examined. The purpose of this paper is to examine the antecedence of SCP through CPFR and SCIC. Design/methodology/approach: Through cluster and stratified random sampling, 286 responses from top managers of 1,574 Nigerian manufacturing companies were analyzed. Data analysis was performed using structural equation modeling with AMOS graphics. Findings: The results show that SCIC has a full mediating effect on the relationship between CPFR and SCP. Specifically, CPFR has a significant relationship with both SCP and SCIC, and SCIC also relates significantly to SCP. Practical implications: This study offers implications for manufacturers in developing countries in general, and in Nigeria in particular, by providing a guideline on how to improve SCP through CPFR. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the limited studies on CPFR and SCP by extending this line of study into the realm of innovation capability and innovation. It integrates the social exchange theory and the dynamic capabilities theory to examine the collaborative processes of CPFR in the supply chain context. This study stressed the importance of boundary theoretical spanning by extending CPFR and SCP into the domain of innovation capability.},

Controlling for other relevant variables, the Labor Strength Index is found to have a weak positive effect on growth, a weak negative effect on income equality and on infant survival and life expectancy levels, and a strong negative effect on infant survival and life expectancy progress. One reason for the negative overall effect of labor strength on human development may be that unions, together with actors representing better-off urban groups, often induce governments to enact urban-biased and formal sector-biased policies that contribute to the neglect or impoverishment of the rural poor and shanty-town dwellers.},

abstract = {In empirical work in economics it is common to report standard errors that account for clustering of units. Typically, the motivation given for the clustering adjustments is that unobserved components in outcomes for units within clusters are correlated. However, because correlation may occur across more than one dimension, this motivation makes it difficult to justify why researchers use clustering in some dimensions, such as geographic, but not others, such as age cohorts or gender. This motivation also makes it difficult to explain why one should not cluster with data from a randomized experiment. In this paper, we argue that clustering is in essence a design problem, either a sampling design or an experimental design issue. It is a sampling design issue if sampling follows a two stage process where in the first stage, a subset of clusters were sampled randomly from a population of clusters, and in the second stage, units were sampled randomly from the sampled clusters. In this case the clustering adjustment is justified by the fact that there are clusters in the population that we do not see in the sample. Clustering is an experimental design issue if the assignment is correlated within the clusters. We take the view that this second perspective best fits the typical setting in economics where clustering adjustments are used. This perspective allows us to shed new light on three questions: (i) when should one adjust the standard errors for clustering, (ii) when is the conventional adjustment for clustering appropriate, and (iii) when does the conventional adjustment of the standard errors matter.},

abstract = {With the aim of examining the causal structure between foreign direct investment (FDI) and economic growth, this study derives inductive causal inference using the directed acyclic graph approach, which makes no a priori causal assumptions. There are three major findings of this study. First, economic growth causes FDI inflows for developing countries, whereas FDI induces economic growth for developed countries. Second, trade is an important intermediary to facilitate the interaction between FDI and other factors. Third, the stock market is found to be an intermediary that amplifies the influence on FDI from many causal variables of FDI for developed countries. Foreign direct investment (FDI) is believed to be an important factor contributing to economic growth. However, previous studies find conflicting results regarding the relationship between FDI and economic growth. Some studies find a positive relationship between FDI and economic growth (see, e.g., Neuhaus, 2006) and argue that FDI boosts growth through capital accumulation and through technology transfer spillover effects, whereas other studies conclude that FDI can distort resource allocation, that the effect is highly conditional on country-specific trade policies and other institutional factors, and that in some cases, FDI can actually inhibit economic growth (see, e.g., Boyd and Smith, 1992; Brecher, 1983; Brecher and Diaz-Alejandro, 1977). Conflicting findings in earlier studies have aroused interest in identifying the causal patterns between FDI and economic growth to better understand their interaction. FDI-led growth is a long-held causal assumption backed by both endogenous growth theory and many empirical studies (De Mello, 1999). Endogenous growth theory proposes that long-run economic growth is determined by forces that are internal to the economic system and that create technological knowledge. These forces may result from research and development undertaken by profit-seeking firms; from economic policies with respect to trade, competition, education, and taxes; and from accumulation of intellectual property. Because FDI is expected to encourage the use of new inputs/technologies and investment in human capital, one might expect that FDI should lead to economic growth in the recipient country, yet both endogenous growth theory and the FDI-led growth assumption},

abstract = {We argue that the US tax system is biased against labor and in favor of capital and has become more so in recent years. As a consequence, it has promoted inefficiently high levels of automation. Moving from the US tax system in the 2010s to optimal taxation of capital and labor would raise employment by 4.02{\%} and the labor share by 0.78 percentage points, and restore the optimal level of automation. If moving to optimal taxes is infeasible, more modest reforms can still increase employment by 1.14-1.96{\%}, but in this case efficiency can be increased by imposing an additional automation tax to reduce the equilibrium level of automation. This is because marginal automated tasks do not bring much productivity gains but displace workers, reducing employment below its socially optimal level. We additionally show that reducing labor taxes or combining lower capital taxes with automation taxes can increase employment much more than the uniform reductions in capital taxes enacted between 2000 and 2018.},

abstract = {Learning about cause and effect is arguably the main goal in applied econometrics. In practice, the validity of these causal inferences is contingent on a number of critical assumptions regarding the type of data that has been collected and the substantive knowledge that is available. For instance, unobserved confounding factors threaten the internal validity of estimates, data availability is often limited to non-random, selection-biased samples, causal effects need to be learned from surrogate experiments with imperfect compliance, and causal knowledge has to be extrapolated across structurally heterogeneous populations. A powerful causal inference framework is required to tackle these challenges, which plague most data analysis to varying degrees. Building on the structural approach to causality introduced by Haavelmo (1943) and the graph-theoretic framework proposed by Pearl (1995), the artificial intelligence (AI) literature has developed a wide array of techniques for causal learning that allow to leverage information from various imperfect, heterogeneous, and biased data sources (Bareinboim and Pearl, 2016). In this paper, we discuss recent advances in this literature that have the potential to contribute to econometric methodology along three dimensions. First, they provide a unified and comprehensive framework for causal inference, in which the aforementioned problems can be addressed in full generality. Second, due to their origin in AI, they come together with sound, efficient, and complete algorithmic criteria for automatization of the corresponding identification task. And third, because of the nonparametric description of structural models that graph-theoretic approaches build on, they combine the strengths of both structural econometrics as well as the potential outcomes framework, and thus offer an effective middle ground between these two literature streams.},

This research aims to explore the role of product and process innovation capabilities as two distinct mechanisms through which collaborative innovation networks improve new product performance. The study also examines the contingent effects of absorptive capacity on the relationship between collaborative innovation networks and the two innovation capability dimensions (i.e. product and process innovation). Survey data from 258 respondents from the Iranian high and medium technology manufacturing industries indicates the need for caution when developing collaborative innovation networks. We found that the effects of collaborative innovation networks on either product or process innovation capability are significant only in the presence of absorptive capacity. This finding suggests that the level of collaboration with different partners can enhance firms' innovation capabilities only if the focal firm's managers have developed the capacity to scan and acquire external knowledge. Our analyses further indicate that in the presence of absorptive capacity, only collaboration with research organizations and competitors have a positive effect on product innovation capability. In the case of process innovation capability, collaboration with research organizations and suppliers are the most important factors.},

A general feature of these models is the presence of constant or increasing returns in the factors that can be accumulated. I use some models of this type to study the determination of per capita growth, investment in physical and human capital, and population growth. The determinants of these variables involve aspects of government policy - including public infrastructure services, maintenance of property rights, government consumption, and taxation - and the initial level of per capita income. I examine the predicted relationships by using a cross-country sample that expands on the Summers-Heston set of about 120 countries. Aside from their data on levels of per capita GDP and the breakdown of GDP into components, I have added information about the composition of government expenditures, proxies for economic freedom and property rights, measures of political stability, and so on. This expansion in variables reduced the number of countries to 72. The findings verify some of the predictions about the determination of growth and investment/saving rates. For example, government consumption and investment spending, and proxies for economic freedom show up as suggested by the models. Also, the interplay among population growth, investment in human capital (school enrollment), and the initial level of per capita income confirm theoretical predictions about the tradeoff between the quantity and quality of children. I anticipate that additional results will emerge from my ongoing research in this area.},

We propose a separation between learning from R{\&}D outsourcing, whereby the firm improves its ability to innovate by using outsourced R{\&}D directly in new products, from learning by R{\&}D outsourcing, whereby the firm indirectly uses outsourced R{\&}D by integrating it with internal R{\&}D to create new products. Building on the knowledge-based view, we argue that learning from R{\&}D outsourcing is likely to have an inverse U-shaped relationship with product innovation, because the initial benefits of using outsourced component R{\&}D knowledge to innovate products is eventually outweighed by the hollowing out of the firm's ability to innovate. In contrast, we propose that learning by R{\&}D outsourcing is likely to have a U-shaped relationship with product innovation, because the initial challenges of integrating internal and external R{\&}D are eventually overcome, resulting in more innovations. Finally, we distinguish between domestic and foreign R{\&}D outsourcing and propose a liability of foreignness in R{\&}D outsourcing as it has a lower impact on new products than domestic R{\&}D outsourcing. The empirical analysis shows that outsourced R{\&}D has an inverted U-shaped relationship with the number of new products, while the interaction between outsourced R{\&}D and internal R{\&}D has a U-shaped relationship with the number of new products. It also shows that domestic outsourced R{\&}D has a higher positive impact on the number of new products than foreign outsourced R{\&}D.},

This minimal set of data points, which is the smallest number of support vectors that completely characterize a separating plane classifier, is considerably smaller than that required by a standard 1-norm support vector machine with or without feature selection. The proposed approach also incorporates a feature selection procedure that results in a minimal number of input features used by the classifier. Tenfold cross validation gives as good or better test results using the proposed minimal support vector machine (MSVM) classifier based on the smaller set of data points compared to a standard 1-norm support vector machine classifier. The reduction in data points used by an MSVM classifier over those used by a 1-norm SVM classifier averaged 66{\%} on seven public datasets and was as high as 81{\%}. This makes MSVM a useful incremental classification tool which maintains only a small fraction of a large dataset before merging and processing it with new incoming data.},
